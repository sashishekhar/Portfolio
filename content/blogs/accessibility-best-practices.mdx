# Web Accessibility (a11y): Best Practices

Web accessibility (often abbreviated as a11y) is the practice of designing and developing websites and applications that can be used by everyone. This is not just a moral obligation but also a legal requirement in many places. Creating accessible sites benefits all users.

## Key Principles
- **Semantic HTML:** Use HTML elements for their intended purpose. For example, use `<button>` for buttons and `<a>` for links.
- **Image `alt` Text:** Provide descriptive alternative text for images so screen readers can describe them to visually impaired users.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all interactive elements can be accessed and operated using only a keyboard.

## Quick Wins for a11y
- **Color Contrast:** Make sure your text and background colors have sufficient contrast.
- **Focus Indicators:** Don't remove the default `outline` on focused elements without providing a clear alternative.
- **ARIA Roles:** Use Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) roles to add context to non-semantic elements when necessary.
