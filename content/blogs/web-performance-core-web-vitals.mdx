# Optimizing Web Performance: Core Web Vitals

Core Web Vitals are a set of specific factors that Google considers important in a webpageâ€™s overall user experience. Optimizing for these metrics is crucial not only for user satisfaction but also for SEO rankings.

## The Three Pillars
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** Measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading.
- **First Input Delay (FID):** Measures interactivity. For a good user experience, pages should have an FID of 100 milliseconds or less.
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** Measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of 0.1 or less.

## How to Improve Scores
- **Optimize Images:** Compress images and use modern formats like WebP.
- **Lazy Loading:** Defer loading of off-screen images and components.
- **Specify Image Dimensions:** Always include `width` and `height` attributes on your images and video elements to prevent layout shifts.
