# An Introduction to TypeScript

TypeScript is a "syntactic superset" of JavaScript, which means it adds features on top of JS, most notably a static type system. By enabling you to define types for your variables, functions, and objects, TypeScript helps prevent common bugs and improves the developer experience.

## Core Benefits of TypeScript
- **Static Type Checking:** Catch type-related errors during development, not in production.
- **Improved Autocompletion:** Code editors can provide better suggestions and intelligence.
- **Enhanced Readability:** Explicit types make code easier to understand and reason about for you and your team.

## Getting Started
- **Installation:** You can install TypeScript globally via npm: `npm install -g typescript`.
- **Compilation:** TypeScript code is compiled into plain JavaScript using the `tsc` command, ensuring it can run in any browser or JavaScript environment.

```typescript
// A simple function with types
function greet(person: string, date: Date): string {
  return `Hello ${person}, today is ${date.toDateString()}!`;
}

console.log(greet("Brendan", new Date()));
