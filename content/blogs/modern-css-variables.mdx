# From SASS to CSS Custom Properties

For years, CSS preprocessors like SASS were the only way to use variables in our stylesheets. Today, CSS Custom Properties are natively supported in all modern browsers, offering dynamic, runtime-accessible variables that unlock new possibilities for theming and design systems.

## Why Use CSS Variables?
- **Dynamic:** Unlike SASS variables, they can be updated with JavaScript in real-time.
- **Cascading Nature:** Variables are inherited and can be scoped to specific elements.
- **Simplified Theming:** Easily create dark/light modes or other themes by changing a few variables on the root element.

## How They Work
- **Declaration:** Declare a variable using a name that begins with two dashes (e.g., `--main-color: #333;`).
- **Usage:** Access the variable's value using the `var()` function (e.g., `color: var(--main-color);`).

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #007bff;
  --text-color: #333;
}

/* Example of a dark theme */
body.dark-theme {
  --primary-color: #1e90ff;
  --text-color: #f0f0f0;
}

button {
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
  color: var(--text-color);
}
