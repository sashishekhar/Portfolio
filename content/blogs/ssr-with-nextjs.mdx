# The Power of Server-Side Rendering with Next.js

Single Page Applications (SPAs) are great, but they can suffer from poor SEO and slow initial load times. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) solves this by rendering the initial HTML on the server. Next.js, a popular React framework, provides a powerful and straightforward way to build SSR applications.

## Why Choose SSR?
- **Better SEO:** Search engine crawlers can easily index the fully rendered HTML page.
- **Faster First Contentful Paint (FCP):** Users see content much faster because the browser receives a ready-to-render HTML file.
- **Improved Performance on Slower Devices:** Less work is required from the client's device to render the initial view.

## SSR in Next.js
- **Page-Based Routing:** Every file in the `pages` directory automatically becomes a route.
- **Data Fetching:** Use `getServerSideProps` to fetch data on each request and pass it as props to your page component.

```javascript
// pages/posts/[id].js
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const { id } = context.params;
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${id}`);
  const post = await res.json();

  return {
    props: { post }, // will be passed to the page component as props
  };
}

function PostPage({ post }) {
  // Render post...
  return <h1>{post.title}</h1>;
}

export default PostPage;
