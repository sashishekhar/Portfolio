# Building APIs with Node.js and Express

Node.js allows you to run JavaScript on the server, making it a powerful choice for building back-end services. When combined with Express, a minimal and flexible web application framework, creating robust REST APIs becomes incredibly straightforward.

## Core Concepts
- **Routing:** Defining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint (URI) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, etc.).
- **Middleware:** Functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.
- **Request and Response:** Handling incoming data (`req.body`, `req.params`) and sending back a response (`res.send()`, `res.json()`).

## Getting Started
- **Setup:** Initialize a Node.js project (`npm init -y`) and install Express (`npm install express`).
- **Create Server:** Write a few lines of code to create a server and have it listen on a port.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(express.json()); // Middleware to parse JSON bodies

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.post('/api/users', (req, res) => {
  const newUser = req.body;
  // Logic to save the user...
  res.status(201).json({ message: 'User created!', user: newUser });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
